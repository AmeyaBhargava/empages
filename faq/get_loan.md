1. **What is the difference between ‘Weekend Loan’ and ‘Avail a Loan’?**

   The ‘Weekend loan’ allows you to avail a loan on Fridays, only to be repaid back by Sunday end of day. It provides you with benefits such as quick loan processing over weekends, easy & automatic repayment and direct credit as eValue on Eko platform.

   The ‘Avail a loan’ option allows you to take a loan for a larger period.

   The transaction history of the merchants as well as CIBIL score are verified before processing a loan.

   There is no fixed value as such but the loan amount depends on how much business you have done.

   In case of default, Eko reserves the right to deduct the amount from your eValue before which a prior notification will be sent to you.
