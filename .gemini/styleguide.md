# Empages Markdown Style Guide

# Introduction

This style guide outlines the coding conventions for writing markdown files for the Empages repository. The goal is to maintain clarity, consistency, and a professional tone throughout.

## General Guidelines
- **Tone and Style:**
  - Use a *clear*, **concise**, and conversational tone.
  - Be logical and directâ€”*tell it like it is; don't sugar-coat responses*.
- **Format:**
  - Use Markdown for structuring content.
  - Employ H2 and H3 headings for sections and subsections respectively.
  - Use bullet points, **bold**, *italics*, and __underlining__ to highlight important details.
- **Headings Condition:**
  - **No bold in headings.** Headings should remain plain text without any bold formatting.

## Markdown Formatting Guidelines
### Headings
- Use H2 (`##`) for main sections.
- Use H3 (`###`) for subsections.
- **Important:** Do not apply bold formatting in any heading.
- The title of the document should only be added in the `title` field of the front matter.
- The title of the document should not be repeated in the body of the document.
- The title of the document must be written in sentence case.

### Emphasis and Styling
- **Bold:** Use to highlight key terms in the body text only.
- *Italics:* Use for emphasizing specific words or phrases.
- __Underline:__ Use to underline critical points.

### Bullet Points
- Use bullet points for lists to improve readability.
- Keep bullet points succinct and directly related to the content.

### Spelling and Grammar
- Ensure correct spelling and grammar throughout the document.


## File Structure
- **Front Matter:**
Every markdown file should begin with valid YAML front matter:
```yaml
---
layout: help
title: "Your Post Title"
---
```
- **File Naming:**
Follow the naming convention: `post-title.md`.


## AI Code-Review Assistant Guidelines
