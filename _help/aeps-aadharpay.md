## What is AePS & AadhaarPay?

### AePS (Aadhaar Enabled Payment System)
AePS is a payment system that allows customers to make transactions using their Aadhaar number and biometric authentication. It enables cash withdrawals, balance inquiries, and mini statements through a network of agents or retailers.

Customers can access their bank accounts and perform transactions without the need for a physical debit card or PIN. AePS is particularly useful in rural and semi-urban areas where banking infrastructure may be limited.

For the "Cash Withdrawal" transaction, the amount will be transferred from the customer's bank account to the retailer's E-value wallet balance. The retailer can then hand over the equivalent cash to the customer.

### AadhaarPay
AadhaarPay is a payment solution that allows merchants to accept payments directly from customers' bank accounts using their Aadhaar number and biometric authentication. It enables cashless transactions, making it easier for retailers to conduct business without the need for cash or cards.

In this transaction, the amount is transferred from the customer's bank account directly to the retailer's registered bank account. Retailer can register their bank account during the AadhaarPay Rioueegistration process.
