## Key Points to Remember

- **Ensure correct UPI ID:** Always double-check the UPI ID before initiating the payment to prevent failed or misdirected transactions.
- **Confidentiality of Agent PIN:** Do not share your agent secret PIN. It is required to securely authorize UPI payments.
- **Accurate Recipient Information:** Carefully review recipient details when adding or selecting recipients to avoid errors.
