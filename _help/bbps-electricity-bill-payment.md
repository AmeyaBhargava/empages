## What is electricity bill payment?

This service enables retailers to pay a customer’s electricity bill across India.

## Step 1: Enter Customer Details

- The **retailer** begins by entering the **customer's mobile number**.  
- A **History Dropdown** populates only when the customer has made at least one prior bill payment. Otherwise, no previous payment details will be shown.
- The retailer can select a previous transaction entry to autofill the rest of the details.
- Otherwise, select the appropriate **Service Provider** from the dropdown, as informed by the customer (e.g. UPPCL, TSSPDCL, BSES, etc.).

- Next, the **retailer** chooses the **Transaction Type**:
  - **Instant**: The payment is processed immediately, ensuring real-time confirmation. This option typically carries a lower commission.
  - **High Commission**: May take slightly longer to reflect, but offers a higher commission to the retailer.
  - **Note**: The High Commission option is only available when the bill amount exceeds ₹3000. 
- The **Bill Account Number** is then entered by the **retailer**.  
  This is the customer's unique identifier (such as a Consumer ID or CA Number) for electricity bill payments.

- After verifying all entries, the **retailer** clicks on **Proceed** to fetch the bill details.

## Step 2: Bill Payment 

- After the bill details are fetched, the next screen will show the **Amount** to be paid.  
  This amount is **auto-filled by the system** based on the bill information fetched.
- The **retailer** then enters their **4-digit secret PIN** to authorize the transaction.
- Once the PIN is entered, the **retailer** clicks on the **Proceed** button.

  - **High Commission** – Higher commission, available **only if the bill amount exceeds ₹3000**.
- Double-check the **Bill Account Number** before proceeding.
- On the payment screen, the **bill amount is auto-fetched**; the retailer only needs to enter the **4-digit secret PIN**.
- The **History Dropdown** will display previous bill transactions linked to the information provided, which can be selected to avoid typing the Bill Account Number.
