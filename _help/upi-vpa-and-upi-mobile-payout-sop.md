## Key Points to Remember

- **Ensure correct UPI ID or Mobile Number:** Always double-check the UPI ID or mobile number before initiating the payout to prevent failed or misdirected transactions.
- **Confidentiality of Agent PIN:** Do not share your agent secret PIN. It is required to securely authorize UPI payments.
- **Verify UPI App Linkage:** Confirm that the recipient's mobile number is correctly linked to a UPI-enabled application.
- **Accurate Recipient Information:** Carefully review recipient details when adding or selecting recipients to avoid errors.
- **Enable Location Access if Required:** For UPI Mobile payouts, ensure location access is enabled when prompted.
