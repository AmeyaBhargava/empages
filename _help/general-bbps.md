## What is BBPS Bill Payments?

The **Bharat Bill Payment System (BBPS)** is a service launched by the **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)** and operated by the **National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI)**. It facilitates seamless bill payments across various categories, including `electricity`, `telecom`, `DTH`, `gas`, `water`, and more.

## Step 1: Select a Bill Payment Category


## Step 1: Enter Customer Details

- The **retailer** begins by entering the **customer's mobile number**.
- A **History Dropdown** populates only when the customer has made at least one prior payment. Otherwise, no previous payment details will be shown.
- The retailer can select a previous transaction entry to autofill the rest of the details.
- Otherwise, select the appropriate **Service Provider** from the dropdown, as informed by the customer.

- Next, the **retailer** chooses the **Transaction Type**:
  - **Instant**: The payment is processed immediately, ensuring real-time confirmation. This option typically carries a lower commission.
  - **High Commission**: May take slightly longer to reflect, but offers a higher commission to the retailer.
  - **Note**: The High Commission option is only available when the amount exceeds ₹3000.
- The **Account Number** is then entered by the **retailer**.
  This is the customer's unique identifier (such as a Consumer ID or CA Number) for bill payments.
