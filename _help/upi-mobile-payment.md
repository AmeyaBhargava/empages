## Key Points to Remember

- **Ensure correct UPI Mobile Number:** Always double-check the UPI mobile number before initiating the payment to prevent failed or misdirected transactions.

- **Verify UPI App Linkage:** Confirm that the recipient's mobile number is correctly linked to a UPI-enabled application.
- **Accurate Recipient Information:** Carefully review recipient details when adding or selecting recipients to avoid errors.
- **Enable Location Access if Required:** For UPI Mobile payments, ensure location access is enabled when prompted.
